## **New York taxi trip analysis**

This project was to self design a research question based on New York's City Taxi and Limousine Service Trip Record Data. The research question design is rather poor. External data such as weather and temperature, as well as New York's sporting events is obtained through web crawling. Categorical features were falsely used and excluded based on pearson correlation (which should only used for continuous variables). New features should be included as boolean variables for each instance of data. 

## **Twitter Sentiment classification**
