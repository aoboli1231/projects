# University of Melbourne Academic Projects Portfolio

This repository showcases a curated selection of projects undertaken during my academic journey at the University of Melbourne. Spanning domains such as Data Analysis, Data Streaming, Parallel Programming, Machine Learning, and Business Analysis. These projects bear testament to my proficiency in tools and technologies like Python, R, Shell, CouchDB, and Jupyter Notebook, as well as libraries such as Numpy, Pandas, Scikit-Learn, and BERT. Notably, the Grove Estate project is excluded due to its private nature. Dive into each project to witness the application of these skills in real-world scenarios.
